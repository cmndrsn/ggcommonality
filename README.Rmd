ggcommonality creates bar plots of unique and joint effects from a
commonality analysis of a linear regression model. The function outputs
a bar plots with unique and common effects for each commonality
partition.

The function is scalable to multiple variables and takes formula
notation for input, calling on the `yhat` package [@nimon2023r].

This function builds bar plots in the style of those appearing in the
[MAPLE Lab's](https://maplelab.net) work applying commonality analysis
to the compositions of Bach and Chopin [@anderson2022exploring].

Partitions are plotted sequentially in alphabetical order, starting with
unique effects and are built iteratively with joint effects at higher
orders on top.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ggcommonality from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("cmndrsn/ggcommonality")
```

## Example

The function produces a barplot of a commonality analysis from a formula
and data set.

```{r example, warning=FALSE}
library(ggcommonality)
library(ggplot2)
# import data
data(mtcars)
p <- ggcommonality(formula = mpg ~ cyl + disp + vs + drat,
                   data = mtcars)
  

print(p)
```

The plot is customizable and can be used with ggprotos.

```{r}
p + scale_fill_manual(values = c("#7fc97f",
                                          "#beaed4",
                                          "#fdc086",
                                          "#ffff99")
                              ) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.7652,
                      linetype = "dashed",
                      color = "grey50") + # adding total explained variance
  annotate(geom="text", x=5, y=.76, label="Total variance explained\n(unique + joint)",
              color="grey50")

```

We can compare the bar plot output to the unique and common effects from
the model:

```{r commonality, warning=FALSE}
yhat_model <- yhat::regr(
  lm(
    formula = mpg ~ cyl + disp + vs + drat,
    data = mtcars
  )
)
knitr::kable(yhat_model$Commonality_Data$CC)
```

To get the x and y coordinates passed to `geom_rect()` when making the
plot, you can use the following line of code, which returns a list with
(1) the data frame used to create the barplot for positive commonalities
(from xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax coordinates); (2) the data frame used
to create the black outline for the positive effects; (3) the data frame
used to create the barplot for negative commonalities; and (4) the data
frame used to create the black outline for the negative effects.

```{r warning=FALSE}
df_commonality <- df_ggcommonality(formula = mpg ~ cyl + disp + vs + drat,
                   data = mtcars)

## Make output shorter
lapply(df_commonality,
       head)

```

# Adding confidence intervals

You can add percentile-based bootstrap confidence intervals using the
`ci_ggcommonality` function. The `resample_type` argument specifies
whether to generate random-*x* confidence intervals or fixed-*x*
confidence intervals. The
[appendices](https://www.john-fox.ca/Companion/) to @fox2018r provide
useful explanations and examples of both types. If
`stack_by = "partition"`, confidence intervals represent the sum of
unique and joint effects for individual commonality partitions.
Otherwise, if `stack_by = "common"`, separate confidence intervals are
generated for the sum of unique effects and the sum of joint effects.

## Adding random-*x* bootstrap confidence intervals

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p +
  ci_ggcommonality(formula = mpg ~ cyl + disp + vs + drat,
                   data = mtcars,
                   n_replications = 100) +
    ci_ggcommonality(formula = mpg ~ cyl + disp + vs + drat,
                   data = mtcars,
                   n_replications = 100,
                   ci_sign = "-")
```

## Adding fixed-*x* bootstrap confidence intervals

```{r, warning=FALSE}
p +
  ci_ggcommonality(formula = mpg ~ cyl + disp + vs + drat,
                   data = mtcars,
                   resample_type = "fixed",
                   n_replications = 100) +
    ci_ggcommonality(formula = mpg ~ cyl + disp + vs + drat,
                   data = mtcars,
                   n_replications = 100,
                   ci_sign = "-",
                   resample_type = "fixed")

```

# Stack by unique vs. common effects

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p2 <- ggcommonality(formula = mpg ~ cyl + disp + vs + drat,
                   data = mtcars,
                   stack_by = "common")

p2 +
  ci_ggcommonality(formula = mpg ~ cyl + disp + vs + drat,
                   data = mtcars,
                   sample_column = "gear",
                   n_replications = 100,
                   stack_by = "common",
                   colour = "grey5",
                   width = 0.5,
                   alpha = 0.5) 
```
