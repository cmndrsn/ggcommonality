\title{Plot Commonality Partitions as a Bar Plot in ggplot}
\usage{
ggcommonality(formula, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Formula passed to regression model}

\item{data}{data argument matching formula}
}
\value{
ggplot object. Unique and common effects presented as a bar plot.
Variance attributable to two variables appears in partition for both.
}
\description{
This function takes a commonality model output from yhat and generates
a bar plot based on the unique and common variance shared between variables.
